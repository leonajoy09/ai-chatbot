# Platform Guideline

In this section, we will explain the concepts in the Azure Platform built by Henkel. The platform has been created to make it easier and faster to use Azure consistently with a high level of security and compliance.
The Azure platform consists of many parts some of which will be introduced in detail in subsequent subpages.

- **Landing Zones** Landing Zones form a cloud environment, in the form of Azure subscriptions, providing a standardized place to provision application infrastructure with a high degree of automation and complying with Henkel standards.
- **Centralized Networking** The network infrastructure is set up to allow communication between workloads in Azure, between the clouds and on-premise. Central network gateways connect to on-premise Henkel office locations worldwide, thus there is no need to set up VPNs or similar services as Azure subscriptions are built-in with integrations to zScaler, SSL VPN and office network.
- **Service Enablement and Security Policies** Landing Zones come with Azure Policies providing guardrails for safe infrastructure development. Each enabled service follows a Service Enablement providing clear guidance to users.
Azure Policies have two purposes; Ensuring that the infrastructure has been configured in a compliant manner and automating manual tasks that would otherwise require a request (e.g. integrating private endpoints with the central DNS server).

## Landing Zone features

Landing Zones on Henkel Azure comes with several features to ease working with infrastructure in Azure Cloud:

| Feature                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Documentation                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Decentralized Access Management                    | With Landing Zones, access management is decentralized to the application team. Each Landing Zone comes with built-in MyID groups and Priviliged Identity Management (PIM) that manage access to a Landing Zone.                                                                                                                                  | [Link](./platform-guide-access-management.md)                                        |
| Azure DevOps integration                           | A Landing Zone is integrated with a Azure DevOps project providing managed Service Connections to the subscriptions with the option to provision build agents. The access management controls also applies for Azure DevOps.                                                                                                                      | [Link](./platform-guide-landing-zone.md#service-connections-within-a-devops-project) |
| Managed Service Principals                         | Each Landing Zone environment (subscription), like dev, test or prod subscriptions, has service principals configured and integrated to the DevOps project. The Service Principal are managed and credentials will automatically renew.                                                                                                           | [Link](./platform-guide-landing-zone.md#service-connections-within-a-devops-project) |
| Managed Virtual networks and automated NSG reviews | Virtual Networks and their Network Security Groups (NSGs) are managed by the Platform. Through landing zone configuration files, application teams can raise Pull Requests requesting changes to virtual networks and network rules. NSGs are automatically reviewed by the Firewall Factory engine providing fast feedback with rule compliance. | [Link](./firewall-factory.md)                                                        |
| Virtual Network integrated build agents            | Build agents can automatically be provisioned by the Platform configuration to provide a smoother integration with Pipeline operations requiring data plane operations for vNET-integrated resources. Build agents come either with a slim Ubuntu base image or using images from Microsoft.                                                      | [Link](./azure-network-buildagents.md)                                               |
| Private DNS zones and DNS resolution               | Private DNS zones can be provisioned by the Platform for Azure services requiring custom Private DNS zones like PostgreSql and Kubernetes, or to allow the application team to control the Private DNS records for their internal applications                                                                                                    | [Link](./azure-network-dns.md#custom-private-dns-zones)                              |
| Virtual Machine features                           | Several features support working efficiently with Virtual Machines. Among several features, the Azure Platform supports Automated Backup, Domain Joining to the Henkel Active Directory and Automated Patching                                                                                                                                    | [Link](../platform-guide/vm/backup.md)                                               |
| Policy Automation                                  | Azure Policies automate and connect centrally managed network components. Private Endpoints provisioned by Application Teams are automatically linked to central Private DNS zones allowing DNS resolution across the entire Henkel Network.                                                                                                      | [Link](./azure-network-private-endpoints.md#supported-services)                      |
| Bastion Host                                       | Bastion Hosts can be deployed from the Platform, providing secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to virtual machines from the Azure Portal or native client.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [Link](./configuration-reference-network.md)                                         |
| NAT Gateway                                        | NAT Gateways can be provisioned from the Platform, providing managedNetwork Address Translation (NAT) service that for outbound connectivity for virtual networks.                                                                                                                                                                                | [Link](./configuration-reference-network.md)                                         |

Landing Zone features and their configuration are stored in configuration files. Application Teams can view their configuation and request changes through Pull Requests.
