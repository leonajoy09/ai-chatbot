# Welcome to Henkel Hybrid Cloud Portal

The Cloud Portal funnels all demands towards the Henkel Cloud platforms such as new Cloud Accounts, Access request or adoption project support.

the Portal UI appears in a canban style and is more elaborated in the individual ticket type sections below. In addition the portal provides an inventory view. Once a user gets cloud ressources, a new Catalog item is created. This helps to overlook cloud resources along its lifecycle from "new" to "finished" status. 

Access the portal to manage tickets and your inventory please visit [Cloud Web Portal](https://cloudportal.henkelgroup.cloud/#/).
