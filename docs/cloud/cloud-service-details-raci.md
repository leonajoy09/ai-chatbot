   - To route and handle user issues a Service Desk setup is recommended
   - Operational team or personas must be linked to the Cloud platform system. Please name a ServiceNow Assignment Group or a dedicated email address in the Cloud demand description to allow the Cloud Platform team to inform you in any case. Otherwise and if missed, notify the cloud team via a Hybrid Cloud Portal Ticket. It is important in the eventual case of an security incident. Security incidents are often to be handled on short notice. Your response time to an incident must meet your application's criticallity. No response can lead into service shutdown by the cloud platform.
