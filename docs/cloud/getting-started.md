# Getting Started
You are eager to get started on your cloud journey and the cloud team is happy to help but before you jump into it then there are a few things to consider to prepare yourself.

The main aspect of Cloud at Henkel is the Cloud Platform and its Landing Zones. These components are further linked below and explained per Cloud Serivce Provider.

The Cloud Platform is meant to be the enabler for application related infrastructure development and operations. The platform is created and operated by the Global infrastructure team with supporting dx departments. The platform is hosted on the actual Cloud Service Provider (CSPâ€™s are Azure and Google Cloud Platform). The platform contains Landing Zones as the largest charging and contract item, served to the user. The Platform contains shared services to offer basic and common functionalities which are needed to run application related infrastructure in the Landing Zones. Landing Zones are automatically created by the platform services upon a cloud portal request. Landing Zones are provided with a three or four tier model from dev, test, prod and sanbox per Application. The core purpose is to ease the integration of applications to the cloud platform. The App Infrastructure is managed by the tenant user by default. The platform offers services that support application infrastructure creation or maintenance.
