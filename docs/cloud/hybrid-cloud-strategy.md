# Hybrid Cloud Strategy Program

We are creating the next generation Henkel cloud infrastructure platform to leverage the innovation potential and scalability of global hyper-scalers, to build a foundation for our BizDevOps teams, and to radically modernize our existing infrastructure landscape.

Global Infrastructure set a vision on how we merge the current disjoint infrastructure into a Hybrid Cloud Platform.

To accomplish this vision, we will reduce the deployment time of infrastructure from weeks to minutes regardless of private or public hyperscaleâ€™s are used and giving flexible control back to our developers via automation. This finally results into the below shown long-term target design.
To get this established, the roadmap is drafted accordingly, consists of multiples waves and various work packages.
