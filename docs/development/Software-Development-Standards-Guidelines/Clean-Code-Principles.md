## Clean Code Principles

Clean code rules that should be followed


Note: The following sub-pages are a summary from the 'Clean Code' book by Robert C. Martin. If you find the information valuable, please consider buying the book, as the summary only scratches the surface, there are many more examples and a lot of valuable info that did not make it to the summary. I tried to keep it short and included what I thought was most valuable.

# The Boy Scout Rule

## Leave the code cleaner than you found it.

If we all checked-in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out, the code simply could not rot. The cleanup doesn’t have to be something big. Change one variable name for the better, break up one function that’s a little too large, eliminate one small bit of duplication, clean up one composite if statement.
