## Coding Standards

We follow the coding standard in our development team to improve readability and maintainability of the code and optimize efficiency under high security.


## Common aspects of coding standard

the naming convention is how your packages, classes methods, variables, etc., should be named. (e.g. camelcase, pascalcase or snake_case)

## File and folder naming and organization
this is how your file and folder should be named and structured

## Formatting and indentation
the code should be written in a standardized format and indentation

## Commenting and documenting
this makes it easy for the reviewer of your code to better understand codes methods and declarations

## Classes and functions
this specifies how classes and functions should behave.

## Testing
this specifies which approach and tools should be used to test the codes
