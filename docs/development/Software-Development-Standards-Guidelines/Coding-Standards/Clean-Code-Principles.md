# Clean Code Principles

Clean code rules that should be followed


Note: The following sub-pages are a summary from the 'Clean Code' book by Robert C. Martin. If you find the information valuable, please consider buying the book, as the summary only scratches the surface, there are many more examples and a lot of valuable info that did not make it to the summary. I tried to keep it short and included what I thought was most valuable.
