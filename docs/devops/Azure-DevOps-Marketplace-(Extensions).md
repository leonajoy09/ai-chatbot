### Where to find extensions?

Please see the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops).

### How can I request installation of an extension?

Once you are in Azure DevOps Marketplace on the desired extension, you can click on the Request button and our dxT DevOps team will receive a notification of the request. 
Please also describe shortly the need for this extension so that we can check if possibly another similar extension is already installed.

### On what basis is an extension request decision taken?

Extensions in Azure DevOps can only be installed to an organization, not individual
projects. Before installation, we check for redundant features, legal aspects and extension maturity. At the same time, not all extensions are directly developed by Microsoft. This means that Microsoft does not offer direct support in case the extensions have bugs and therefore we need to be careful about the quality of the installed extensions.

### I need a paid extension. Who pays for that?

Paid extensions are not covered by dxT DevOps team, the requestor team will cover the extension costs and handle the ordering process. Standard Henkel regulation applies.
