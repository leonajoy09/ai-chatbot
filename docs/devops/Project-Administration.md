## I am a project administrator in Azure DevOps. What are my first steps for project setup?
We have prepared a Henkel specific document to help you with the first steps in your Azure DevOps 
project. You can download the Azure DevOps - Project Administrator Checklist [here](././attachments/ADO_checklist_project_admins_v3.pdf).

##  What are my general project administrator responsibilities?
As a project administrator, you are fully responsible for managing the content and members of your Azure DevOps project. Basic tasks are stated below:

* Become familiar with [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/henkeldx/) as a tool and also what you can do as a project administrator
You can find official Microsoft documentation on how to manage your projects [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/user-guide/project-admin-tutorial?view=azure-devops)
* Add other project administrators to your [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/henkeldx/) project (e.g. backup project administrator in case of absence)
* Invite project members to your Azure DevOps project
* If you want to add external collaborators as project members, you need to first invite the external collaborators in myID
* Grant or restrict member permissions
* Scale up the knowledge of your project members on how to use Azure DevOps
* You are the point of contact for your project members in case 
  of questions regarding how to use the tool based on their roles, of questions on access and permissions and if they 
  need additional extensions from [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops)
* Share the internal DevOps guidelines and policies with your project members
* Create a wiki for your project (e.g. to have the internal administrative information in one place: team guidelines, points of contact, etc.). Make sure that everyone in the team is aware of and has access to wiki
* Maintain and manage project information and configuration, such as process configuration, group assignments and description.

## What are the Henkel DevOps Team's responsibilities in Azure DevOps?

Please consider the following responsibilities as the domain of the [Henkel DevOps Team](https://henkelgroup.sharepoint.com/teams/DevOps/SitePages/DevOps.aspx):

* Azure DevOps user license management (ordering and billing)
* Creation of new Azure DevOps projects
* Creation of new Azure DevOps organizations
* Change of user access levels
* Install extensions for projects from [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops)
* Change user permissions, e.g. to be able to customize processes through the user interface
* Set organization guidelines and policies to ensure best practices
* Consulting on best practices.

## How do I invite members to my project?

There are two ways in which you can invite members to your Azure DevOps project:

1. Use the 'Invite' button from the main page of your Azure DevOps project. If you have created several teams beforehand within your project, you can now also directly select in which team to add them (to learn more, see [About teams and Agile tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings?view=azure-devops)).
2. Use the Project settings tab. Open your project and then select *Project settings > Teams*. Either create a new team or select an existing team where the new members should be added to. Select '*Add*' and then '*Save*'.

After you add members to your project, each member gets an invitation email. They can use this link to sign in to the organization and find your project. First-time members might be asked for extra details when they sign in to personalize their experience.

## A member of my project has left the company. What should I do as a project administrator?

Please have a look at [Removing access from an Azure DevOps organization](https://docs.henkelgroup.cloud/devops/azure-devops-and-github-faq/#removing-access-from-an-azure-devops-organization).

### Removing access to a project

This may apply if a user is switching departments or just isn't working in that project anymore.  
In that case, project administrators can just remove the user from all project groups and, in case the user was an administrator, remove user from that list, as well.
