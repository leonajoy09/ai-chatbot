# Software version control and code repositories

!!! warning
    Intellectual Property procured and made for Henkel **must be accessible down to source code level for Henkel and may not be shared unless contractually agreed.**

## Version Control

Use version control and especially *git* for storing all source code and even documentation related to your project. 
Work with *branching strategies* to enable several members to work independently and build gates with *pull requests* to peer-review your code.

A lot on branching can already be read on the internet. Refer to:

- [Microsoft about Git branching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops)
- [Atlassian about workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/de/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
- [Google about trunk based development](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-tech-trunk-based-development)
!!! tip
    If in doubt, ask our [Henkel DevOps Team](mailto:devops_support@henkel.com).

## Version Control Systems

Currently Henkel offers Azure DevOps Repositories to store your code. You can share code with anyone on your Azure DevOps project and use branching policies and complex setup to ensure your code maintains high quality. 
In conjunction with Azure DevOps Pipelines and Azure DevOps Artifacts, it is a powerful tool for delivering software solutions.
