## What is DevOps, Azure and Azure DevOps?

DevOps is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development *(Dev)* and software operation *(Ops)*.
It accelerates business by faster implementation of new IT solutions through full accountability of joint development and
operation teams using agile and lean practices based on automation tools.

Azure and Azure DevOps are two separate entities in the Microsoft environment.

Azure is a platform by Microsoft, which focuses on storage solutions,
machine learning, virtual machines (virtual computers), Azure SQL, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Active Directory and much more.
All offered services can be viewed [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/).

Azure DevOps, on the other hand, is a tool by Microsoft, which provides services to support teams
to plan work, collaborate on code development and build and deploy applications
and its main features include Boards, Wiki, Dashboards, Repos, Pipelines, Test Plans and Artifacts.

## What is the main difference to Confluence?
Section | Azure DevOps | Confluence
:-------- | :-------- | :--------
Wiki/Documentation   | 	&#x2714;   | 	&#x2714;
Dashboards   | &#x2714;   | -
Boards   | &#x2714;   | -
Repos   | &#x2714;   | -
Pipelines   | &#x2714;   | -
Artifacts   | &#x2714;   | -
File sharing   | limited  | &#x2714;



Azure DevOps consists of different subtools, which allows agile working between departments with different needs in just one tool. 

Confluence is primary an information library to document projects or team relevant data and processes.
