# DevOps Documentation section

This DevOps documentation section is maintained by Henkel dxT DevOps team and serves as our single source of truth for documentation.

DevOps is about the way of collaborating between software development and operational teams. 
The term "DevOps" does not necessary describe a technology rather than a culture. 
It should not be confused with [Azure DevOps], which is a tool at Henkel provided by our DevOps team.
