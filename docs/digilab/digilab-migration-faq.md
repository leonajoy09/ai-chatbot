# DigiLab Migration FAQ

If your question is not covered here, please [contact us](mailto:digilab-requests@henkel.com) and we will add it to the list below.

## FAQ

### Why migrate to Frankfurt?

Henkel has decided to run its production workload in its own datacenter in the future instead of hosting it with a provider. 

It makes sense to use the same platform for the DigiLab as well.

### Why can't I stay in old DigiLab?

The hardware is already older than five years. Henkel has decided to save the invest in new hardware in favor of the new datacenter.
As a result, the maintenance of the hardware was not extended.

### What will be the costs for a VM in the new DigiLab in Frankfurt?

You will be informed about the future cost structure in time before annual budget planning.

### Which Chronos order should we use to book costs (also for external partners) and hours caused by this migration?

It is not intended to provide an order or a cost center. The effort for this migration has to be covered by yourself as the DigiLab resources have been provided free of charge up to now.

    Dear VM owner,

    You are receiving this mail because you own at least one VM in the DigiLab. 

    Henkel has decided that the DigiLab will be discontinued in its current form. Currently, a new Henkel datacenter in Frankfurt is being prepared. Over the next months, we will migrate DigiLab workloads to the new datacenter.

    The workload costs in the new datacenter are covered for 2023. However, you should budget for 2024  and later. You will be informed about the future cost structure in time before annual budget planning.

    For the migration of your VMs, you will be approached in time with additional technical information.
