# Onboarding

This page is to help members who are new joiners or old joiners that forget :-)
It is focused on Mac users, but the same mechanisms apply for all Henkel users.

## MyID

- Is a self-service portal for Active Directory group join and access requests
- It can be found with the short name [MyID](http://myid/) or its FQDN https://myid.henkelgroup.net/
- Is used to onboard externals using the *Invite Business Partner* function

## VPN
