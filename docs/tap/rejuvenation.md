# Rejuvenation

The Rejuvenation Project will take care that the partially outdated footprint in the data center, concerning releases, versions and underlying designs will be - in the literal sense of the word - rejuvenated.

The change from old to new will be conducted using a method called "Application Re-Deployment" (as a default).
This method implies that the target infrastructure will be build according to the individual requirements, but from standardized components, and the applications will be re-deployed aka. re-installed
and their data will be migrated. That way, an application or system will be rejuvenated.
