# Terms of Use

Any part of these terms can be subject to future update, change or replace. All current Hybrid Cloud Platform (former Henkel Managed Cloud) are informed about changes via mail. A continued use of the Hybrid Cloud Platform after being provided with the information about a change to these Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at the Henkel Hybrid Cloud Platform Portal [https://docs.henkelgroup.cloud/terms-of-use/](https://docs.henkelgroup.cloud/terms-of-use/).

1. Your Henkel Hybrid Cloud Platform account (hereinafter also referred to as: information asset) is provided as a compilation of cloud-based Henkel Hybrid Cloud Platform technologies to transport, store and process data. The information asset is provided as an empty shell without any data content.

2. The nature of the information asset is temporary i.e. any content in it is wiped out at the end of the agreed utilization time as documented in the use case document and confirmed in written form by the HCP team. The HCP is currently running on an interim environment. If you plan to operate your HCP App long term, foresee additional budget and time for later migration to the target environment.  

3. An HCP App is based on the technological and organizational foundation of the HCP. Today most HCP components must be considered  in a proof-of-concept state, provided without centralized maintenance or SLA. If you plan to offer a productive HCP App including SLA, you must organize maintenance within your HCP App team.

4. Access to your information asset is provided for the use of authorized users only. If Henkel has not authorized you to access this service, you must logout immediately. Authorized users must read, agree with and accept all the terms and conditions contained in this notice before using this service.  

5. If you are technically enabled to grant access to other users, you must clarify upfront if a user is authorized to access the content in the information asset. An access approval process can be aligned with affected data owners or must be obtained as written approval by the user's supervisor and all data owners (e.g. via email). If a reporting front-end is used, data level permissions, as provided with the data, must be applied.

6. All transport, processing and storing of data in the information asset must comply with the Corporate Standard Information Security (CSIS) as available at [http://csis](http://csis) . You as HCP App Owner are fully responsible for the content of your HCP App.

7. Identify the Classification for your HCP Apps data and review it when you add new data. Create and implement an Access Control Concept. Regularly review it. Regularly review access rights and remove obsolete access (leavers & movers)  

8. You agree that your activities within the information asset will:  
    - not introduce any software or computer programming routines that may damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information,  

    - not create any liability for us (i.e. the team providing the Henkel Hybrid Cloud Platform)

    - not violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation (including, but not limited to those, GDPR, governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition and antidiscrimination),

    - not contain personal sensitive data (as anything revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, health, sexual orientation or a person's aptitude),

    - not be used for behavior and performance control or to impose a personal risk or disadvantage for individuals,

    - not infringe any third party’s copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights,

9. In order to maintain Henkel Hybrid Cloud Platform Apps and their smooth operation and for the purpose of preventing misuse, Henkel routinely monitors and logs traffic and connection data. Henkel uses and stores the data only to the extent permitted or requested by GDPR. By accepting these terms and conditions of use, you explicitly agree to the data use and storage.  

10. These Terms of Use are governed by German Law. Should any of the above provisions be or become (partly) invalid, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. The invalid provision shall than be replaced by a valid provision that comes closest to the intention of the invalid provision.  
Privacy Guideline for the Use of HCP Apps (hereinafter referred to as information asset)
Personal Information must only be processed if this is lawful. All measures taken for that purpose shall be documented in a separate Desktop Procedure. This Desktop Procedure governs what data categories of whom are processed, including the purpose of the data processing and its legal basis. This document regulates who/what data processors have access to personal data. The Desktop Procedure must be made available to all involved parties (users internal, users external, data processors) in order for them to comply. This document is available at your Corporate Compliance Department (link). A customized template for HCP Apps is available at the Henkel Hybrid Cloud Platform Portal.
The Primary Owner of the Service, hereinafter referred to as Information Asset Owner, is obliged to

1. Register the information asset in the Inventory of Processing Operations available at your Corporate Compliance Office in case more personal data than provided by "O365 contact information" is processed.  

2. Collect, store and process personal data only according to Henkel Compliance E-Learning “GDPR”
3. Assign access rights to user only to the extent needed; access rights must be maintained and reviewed on a regular basis and documented in an Access Control Concept.
